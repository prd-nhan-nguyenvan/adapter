The Adapter pattern allows you to convert one interface into another, enabling incompatible classes to work together.

In your code:

- `Client` is the original class with a specific interface.
- `ColorClient` is an adapter that extends `Client` and overrides the `_output` method to add color to the output.
- `App` is the client code that relies on the `Client` interface, but it can work with any subclass of `Client`, including `ColorClient`.

Hereâ€™s how the Adapter pattern is implemented in your code:

1. **Original Class**: `Client` provides the base interface.
2. **Adapter Class**: `ColorClient` adapts `Client` to provide colored output.
3. **Client Code**: `App` interacts with the `Client` interface, but it can seamlessly work with `ColorClient` or any other subclass of `Client`.

Example of usage:

```python
from ColorClient import ColorClient

if __name__ == "__main__":
    from App import App
    app = App(client=ColorClient(23, 45))  # Using ColorClient as the client
    app.main()
```

In this setup, `App` can work with any subclass of `Client`, making your code flexible and adhering to the Adapter pattern.
